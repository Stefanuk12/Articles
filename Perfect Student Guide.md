# Sleep

Whenever we sleep, that is when the information is properly consolidated and put into long-term memory. However, the traditional night sleep might not be convenient, and you might be wasting a lot of time where you could be more productive. A solution to this is polyphasic sleep.

Watch the following video for more information: [Hack Your Brain with Polyphasic Sleep - YouTube](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OuizzRCALCU)

I suggest you look into this thoroughly and plan your lecture times around your preferred schedule. Ideally, this would mean you would be more awake, getting enough sleep, and more productive.

# Lectures

During lectures and lessons, many students write notes during the lesson. The advantage of writing notes during the lecture is that you do not have to write them later. However, since your attention is diverted towards writing, this means your full attention is not on listening. It is important to listen to what is said and try to understand what is being said.

After the lecture, you must perform some active recall by applying the knowledge you have learned and making notes. Active recall will help you consolidate your knowledge the most.

# Writing flashcards and notes

## Notes

When writing notes, most students will repeat themselves when talking about areas which apply to other areas. For example, you might redefine what a certain word means. This is inefficient, and it might hinder your ability to go back and add to your notes since you will have to update it everywhere. So, you need a system where you can write the specific note once, and it would apply everywhere.

One approach is to split each thing into its own note. This works but can take up a lot of paper. The solution is to go digital.

Break your notes up into concepts and then you can link to the files which explain these concepts. This means that if you forgot what a specific concept means, you can easily click on the link (to the concept) on the page and you will have instant access to everything that is relevant.

If you are looking for ideal software to write these notes on, I recommend Obsidian mostly and Notion secondly. For more information on this, view this video: [How to achieve more while studying less - Obsidian & Conceptual Notes - YouTube](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MYJsGksojms).

For some of you, Obsidian may not look aesthetic. However, it is highly customisable, and you could find some themes that you like. An example of a clean "vault" can be found here: [Showcase | Obsidian Full Build 2023 - YouTube](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hsme9MOW-rc)

## Flashcards

The beauty of Obsidian is that there are many plugins you can install. One of them being a "spaced repetition" flashcard plugin. By doing your flashcards in a specific way, you could merge the process of making flashcards and notes all in one by "inlining" the flashcard into the notes.

# University Life

## Assignments

Generally, complete the assignments ASAP. If you complete them as soon as you get them, that means your mind can rest easy and you can focus on what actually needs your attention.

## Timetable

Make sure to plan in additional study sessions into your current timetable to allocate yourself time to do work.

## Have fun

Some people have a heavily unbalanced work-life balance. Make sure you take breaks from work, go out and have fun. By doing too much, you will burn out and your studying will be inefficient.

# Study technique

1. Do not cram everything within one study session.
2. Improve your weak points
	3. Do not only study what you're good at

It is important that you space out your studying across mini sessions across the day. A common thought is to "get it out of the way." By having this mindset, you are setting yourself up for failure as you associate doing work with something negative. I am not saying be excited to do work but think about delayed gratifications and what you will get by the end. It is important that you stay motivated.

Do little, often.

# Conclusion

By applying these principles, you should be able to get away with three to five hours of studying a day at a maximum while getting those top grades. The idea is to be as efficient as possible. The current techniques are used by the smartest, but it is important to consider causation vs correlation. Just because someone smart did many hours every day, wrote notes the old style, etc., doesn't mean that their methods are the best. You can match their ten hours of revision with only three by being more efficient.
