# Are Flashcards USELESS?

Majority of students write notes and flashcards immediately after learning something. Dumping everything they have learnt into flashcards. However, you must be critical about what information you are putting into spaced repetition. By dumping knowledge into flashcards results in

- Having to catch up with **many** cards on a daily basis
- Promotes '**isolated**' learning
	- Recognise the flashcard by the first few words
	- Instantly know the answer,
	- so when you're asked in a different context, it's hard to recall.

Recognition is listed as the lowest type of thinking, as said by ![Bloom's Taxonomy](https://images.prismic.io/go1prod/55259e57a8a8f12a0f623b1759a655be473f47d1_blooms-graphic.png?auto=compress,format)

When it comes to flashcards, only put the information that you couldn't remember initially.

Applying this principle, all of your flashcards at the moment are simple fact recall but they can be improved.

## Improving your flashcards

After you get a card **right** many times **consecutively**:
- Merge the flashcard with another within the same branch
- Invokes higher-level thinking by making you apply and analyse that knowledge

After you get a card **wrong** many times **consecutively**:
- Stop learning that card with purely spaced repetition
- Focus more on that area within your longer study sessions

## WHY this works

To teach content, it must be taught linearly otherwise a student would be lost. However, this does not mean it has to be revised linearly. Our brains are large networks, with many connections between neurons. It is difficult to remember steps when there is nothing linking one to the next. Therefore, by creating connections and relationships between things, it is easier for the brain to step through.

## Flashcards are NOT all they seem to be

Some students solely rely upon flashcards and notes for their education and as covered before, this does not involve higher level thinking. If you talk to someone who does have this higher level thinking and make them explain something to you, you'll probably have the thought process of

- Oh, I never thought about it in this way
- That makes a lot more sense

So, how can you invoke higher-level thinking? When people think about revision techniques that relate to how our minds work, the first thought are mind maps. They are great but often used **wrong**.

## Mind maps, is the HYPE justified?

Mind maps are a very effective tool and should be used as often as possible. As the common adage goes: "a picture paints a thousand words". A paragraph of text, can easily be summarised in a picture. The important part is that the mind maps are **yours**, do what you feel would help you memorise easier.

However, there is a **WRONG** way to make mind maps: cramming too much information, **in terms of text**.

When you look at a student's mind map, you might find that it's more of a wall of text, rather than a visual mind map. If the point of a mind map is to visually show information, why do we have so much text?

The main advantage of mind maps is that they invoke higher level thinking by making us summarise key topics into **minimal** words and pictures while creating **relationships** between topics. It is **imperative** you think about the links between words **and** the bigger picture. By doing this, you are reaching the highest level of thinking.

## Understanding by NOT understanding

This seems counter-intuitive. How can you understand something, by not trying to understand it in the first place?

By creating these mind maps, we are invoking higher levels of thinking and our brain simply fills in the lower levels for us. For example, when learning to code you might try to make a simple application. You might not understand what you are doing but by trying things out, in the end you will understand every part, how it works, and how it relates to the big picture (the overall functionality of the program).

If you critically think about a problem, understanding will follow.

## Don't LIMIT yourself

When studying, it's easy to fall into bad habits or stick to a specific method and not try others. Try other methods, and even if you don't like them initially, they might grow on you. However it's important to note that many other parts play into your study effectiveness, other than technique, like mindset.
