# How to learn programming and some general tips

When it comes to programming, there are two types: programming and scripting. Generally, programing is when you code in a language which is compiled while scripting is when you code in a language which is interpreted. To make this easier to write, I will prefer to them as the same thing.

## Types of programming languages styles

There are two types of programming language styles: C-Style and functional. As implied in the name, C style languages base their syntax on the C programming language, while functional languages are based on the lambda calculus.

Functional languages are commonly used to write code that can be ran in parallel, making them ideal to process a lot of data. For example, Haskell is a functional language that is immutable, meaning that the data cannot be changed, only copied then transformed. As a result, many instances of the program can be ran at the same time, without the risk of one part of the program changing the same data that another part of the program is working on.

On the other hand, C-Style languages can be used for the same purpose, but it's a lot harder to make sure that the whole operation runs smoothly. The big advantage of C-Style languages is that, in my opinion, they are easier to learn and are more applicable to a wider range of tasks.

## Learning one C-Style language = learning them all

The huge advantage of C-Style languages is that once you fully understand one, it is a lot easier to learn another. Since they have similar syntax, you can easily adapt to them. The only issue is learning the libraries and techniques that are specific to that language. For example, creating an object or a string might be different in Lua than in Python. However, the basic syntax is the same or quite similar, making it a lot easier to learn another if you've mastered one.

## Watching tutorials

Tutorials can be a great source of information when it comes to learning how to program. However, they can also be a huge waste of time. The best way to learn is to try to make something yourself. If you're stuck, then you can look up a tutorial on how to do that specific thing. This way, you will learn a lot more and you will be able to apply what you've learned to other projects.

I believe that experience is the best way to learn. You can read all the books in the world, but if you don't apply what you've learned, then you won't learn anything. Make a basic calculator, a simple game with no graphics, something that you can do in a day or two. This way, you will learn a lot more than if you were to watch a tutorial on how to make a calculator.

## Misconception: you need to memorise each function

Programming languages are huge. There are many different functions and libraries that you can use. However, you don't need to memorise each property, or each string method, for example. You just need a rough idea of what you want to do, then Google (or ChatGPT) the function you are looking for. Your IDE should be able to help you with this, as intellisense can show you all of the available functions and methods that you can use when you type a dot after a variable, for example. Overtime, you will remember the most common functions and methods, but you don't need to memorise them all.

## The use of AI in learning

AI can be a great tool when it comes to learning programming. For example, ChatGPT can help you with your code, by suggesting functions and methods that you can use. It can also help you with your logic, by suggesting a better way to do something. However, you should not rely on it too much. You should try to solve the problem yourself, then ask ChatGPT for help if you're stuck. This way, you will learn a lot more than if you were to ask ChatGPT for help right away.

It's okay to feel confused when you're learning programming. It's a complex subject, and it takes time to master. However, if you keep at it, you will get better. Just remember to take breaks, and don't get too frustrated if you can't solve a problem right away. It's all part of the learning process.

## The BIGGEST skills you need to learn

1. Googling

This might be an obvious thing. Everyone knows how to Google right? Well, not really. Googling is a skill that you need to learn. You need to know how to phrase your question in a way that Google can understand. You cannot just ask your question, as you would to ChatGPT, and get an answer out. You need to abstract the problem, then ask Google for a solution in your specific scenario. This is a skill that you will learn over time, but it's one of the most important skills you can have as a programmer. Do not ask Google how to make a game from scratch, instead try to make it yourself and ask Google for help on specific parts, like collision detection in PyGame, for example. Someone has probably already asked the same question, and with proper Googling skills, you can find the answer a lot easier and learn faster.

2. Reading documentation

Documentation can be quite overwheling at first. However, knowing how to properly read documentation means you don't need to rely on others and Google to achieve a specific thing. Majority of documentation is made using similar sites and builders, so you'll get used to them quickly if you make an effort to learn how to read them. Sometimes Google cannot help, but the documentation can.

## Conclusion

Learning programming is not easy. It takes time and effort to master. However, with the right mindset and the right tools, you can achieve anything. Remember to take breaks, and don't get too frustrated if you can't solve a problem right away. It's all part of the learning process. Good luck!
